# cash_discover

This project demos how Square seller coupons can be seamlessly integrated into CashApp. CashApp users who have never purchased from a given Square seller can discover seller coupons through multiple entry points: search by Category, infinite Discover scroll feed, or the Nearby You using embedded Google Maps API. The backend is lightweight and maintained on Firebase.
